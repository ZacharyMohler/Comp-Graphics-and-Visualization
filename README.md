### How do I approach designing software?
My approach to desgining software usually follows a pattern of:
1) understanding/gathering requirements
2) creating a rough outline program
3) fine tuning the program to meet all requirements

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project taught me essential skills in 3D design that I was previously unequipped with

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed the design process of creating the functional code before focusing on the quality of the visual elements

### How did iteration factor into your development?
On a week-to-week basis new features and techniques were implemented in the project. This lead to many different iterations, each of which was more complex than the previous

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
By securing me a stable job to provide for my family

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
It allows me to easily create models to visualize data, which is a great tool to have

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Graphics are very difficult to program from scartch, and is quite impressive to be able to do. This allows me to create more impressive projects for my portfolio and stand out among job candidates
